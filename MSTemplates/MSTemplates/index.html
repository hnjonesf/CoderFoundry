                <h3>Mosquito Squad Sales and Marketing, 2016</h3>
                <p>The personal mosquito control industry is headed toward maturity. Mosquito Squad has established itself as the industry leader, but we must continue to adapt our sales and marketing to stay out front. We have been driven by excellent customer service, along with great information, but this is not enough. Our offices must become <strong>sales-first</strong>, to gain the market share needed to survive.</p>


                    <strong>Methodology: </strong>Sales and marketing efforts must become about building route density by an outbound, cordinated effort.
                    <ul>
                        <li style="font-size: medium">Develop a Sales Wizard that walks a representative through the process of selling this service, upselling, and collecting the necessary data.</li>
                        <li style="font-size: medium">Print letters by campaign from the CRM, in small batches, and customized to each home with a quote for service.</li>
                        <li style="font-size: medium">Flyers. Make sales visits to the targeted neighborhoods, preferably in the afternoon and evening when people are home. Distribute flyers or quotes, customized for the homes. Include some neighborhood signs.</li>
                        <li style="font-size: medium">Online. Coordinate a pay per click text, display, and video ads targeting each campaign. Emails (Constant Contact? or CRM?) and web sites must support re-marketing. Include creative videos that can be used as pay-per-click ads, placed inside of emails, blogs, and our social media. Our videos, at present, are informative and not sales focused. Our national budget should be used to create these sales driven video spots that are specifically formatted. </li>
