What makes a great email sales campaign

Story: a character, who has a problem, that meets a guide, that has a clear solution, and calls them to action, that results in: success or failure.
Graphic that highlights the solution. Not too large, and web-optimized.
Common look/feel of tag lines, usually coupled to the graphic.
White space.
Call to action-clear.
Social: use buttons to keep their role small.
Test before production.
