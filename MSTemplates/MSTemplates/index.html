                <h3>Mosquito Squad Sales and Marketing, 2016</h3>
                <p>The personal mosquito control industry is going to reach maturity soon. Mosquito Squad has established itself as the industry leader, but we must continue to adapt our sales and marketing to keep ourselves at the forefront of the industry. We have been driven by excellent customer service, along with great information. Our offices must be <strong>sales-first</strong>, to gain the market share needed to survive.</p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Methodology: </strong>Sales and marketing efforts must become about building route density by an outbound, cordinated effort.
                    <ul>
                        <li style="font-size: medium">Prospects. Load into the CRM/Constant Contact/Other for all Target Households in each franchise market. Group leads into campaigns by neighborhoods, and establish rolling promotion dates for each campaign within the CRM's zip zones. This could be a use of the marketing fund in purchasing for each franchise.</li>  
                        <li style="font-size: medium">Outbound calls. Ability by campaign using a dialer integrated with the CRM. This will require a Sales Wizard that walks a representative through the process of selling this service, and collecting the necessary data.</li>
                        <li style="font-size: medium">Print letters by campaign from the CRM. These are done in small batches and are customized to each home with a quote for service. </li>
                        <li style="font-size: medium">Make sales visits to the targeted neighborhoods, preferably in the afternoon and evening when people are home. Distribute flyers or quotes, customized for the homes. </li>
                        <li style="font-size: medium">Send Emails by campaign from the CRM to these prospects with compelling, neighborhood offers.</li>
                        <li style="font-size: medium">Coordinate a pay per click text, display, and video ads targeting each campaign. Emails and web sites must support re-marketing. Include creative videos that can be used as pay-per-click ads, placed inside of emails, blogs, and our social media. Our videos, at present, are informative and not sales focused. Our national budget should be used to create these sales driven video spots that are specifically formatted. </li>
                    </ul>

                    Templates designed for outbound sales to non-customers. The links are to the national site "Contact the Squad" form.  The phone, terms, blog, remarketing tag, and email links need updated by each franchisee.
